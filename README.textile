h2. Pulp Utilities Collection

This package contains many commonly reimplemented utility classes and functions covering the following major areas:

* attribute, case-insensitive, and multi-value dicts
* py3k source compatibility (without using 2to3)
* string to rich datatype conversion of bools, simple arrays, and complex keyword/tag parsing
* rich OOP helpers: nested list flattening, a NoDefault implementation, dot-notation object loading, and a LRU cache
* path manipulation
* UTC and universal time constants

This package will likely grow to include a number of additional nifty things in the future.
